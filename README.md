## Analyzing Stock Performance

### For this project, I will assume the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. My job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data you will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks we will work with are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

## Summary

### This course is intended to demonstrate foundational Python skills for working with data. The completion of this course involves working on a hands-on project developing a dashboard using Python.
